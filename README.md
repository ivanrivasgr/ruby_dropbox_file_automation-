# Ruby Dropbox File Automation

This project automates the processing and routing of uploaded files using the Dropbox API.

### ‚úÖ What this automation does

- Detects new files uploaded into a Dropbox folder.
- Identifies file type based on prefix (e.g., `CUST`, `ORD`, `INV`).
- Cleans and transforms CSV content (dates, phone numbers, whitespace, etc.).
- Moves the transformed file to the appropriate destination folder.
- Deletes original files to maintain a clean Dropbox environment.
